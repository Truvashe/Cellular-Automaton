SRC -> CONTAINS ALL REPS I WILL TALK ABOUT HERE

SRC.TEST -> THE MAIN TEST FILE (i test code there)
SRC.MAIN -> CONTAINS RESOURCES[did not use that] AND JAVA REPS

SRC.MAIN.JAVA -> CONTAINS THE CORE (main repository)

SRC.MAIN.JAVA.CORE -> CONTAINS THE MAIN PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

SRC.MAIN.JAVA.DATA -> ALL DATA CLASSES :
	The data classes is used to store elements data. It is mutable (can be changed).
	elements :	cell 	-> cell position
					 	-> cell energy
					 	-> number of cells created in this program
				
				chunk	-> chunk Id
						-> List of all the cells in the chunk
						-> List of all the food in the chunk
						
				clan	-> still empty for now
				
				food	-> food position
						-> the amount of energy it gives
						
				world	-> world height and width
						-> array[2] of chunks height and width
						-> number of chunk in the world
						-> Hash map of cell Id to cell data 
						-> Hash map of food Id to food data
						
SRC.MAIN.JAVA.ID -> ALL ID CLASSES :
	Each of the element that needs an ID, have it's record here. (immutable)
	[CellID,ChunkID,ClanID,FoodID]
	Elements that uses position as their ID : [ChunkID,FoodId]
	
SRC.MAIN.JAVA.INTENT -> Cells intentions center
	CellIntent an interface that shapes the intent classes. Needs a CellId.
	Intent classes : Eat,Move,Idle
	
SRC.MAIN.JAVA.SNAPSHOT -> The record of data needed to save, replay recreate the world.
	Still empty for now.
	
SRC.MAIN.JAVA.VALUE ->  Contains all "special" types of data.
	Position2D, a two integers data, the height and width.
	Stat, a class with a maximum and minimum, useful for energy, health and so on. Automatically keep the value between the lines.
	
SRC.MAIN.JAVA.SYSTEM -> contain all files and repositories that play around with the data to "make something/make a change"
	contains the intent collector file which treats all cells of a world to collect all intents.

SRC.MAIN.JAVA.SYSTEM.APPLY -> Applying intent system. Change the world and data accordingly.

SRC.MAIN.JAVA.SYSTEM.APPLY -> Rules that each cell play and check to make an intent.
