WARNING :
I lied, there is no documentation.
it's just chaos.

EMERGENT COMPLEXITY :

This project seek studying primal society complexities.

2D world, grid based, each entity is a cell.

entities are configured by these settings :
	energy (at 0 it dies, max 100) (energy controls state also, when low can have more chance going hostile)
	relationship/clan (could be in a group of cells - society) (it also controls state, i would like to see clan wars emerge)
	state (peaceful, vengeance, hostile, scared) (each state changes by luck, this luck augments depending on what happened)
Each entity can move, eat, attack, reproduce.
Entities could die by :
	Energy at 0
	sur-population
	killed by other cell

Energy is gained by eating food.

There are also food as a resource. it augments energy.


I will be using threads as is Thread Pools. It will manage group of cells.

Streams shall be used to calculate metrics. Cell that survived the most, number of deaths, clans created, clans destroyed etc...

Databases are made to store the worlds state, like a save file.

The simulation may be interactive by giving the user a way to build the world. putting food, entities and walls.


Let's get here some group of entities with each a solid task that shape it's actions :

Leader of a clan : other entities follows it (moves beside it)
Reporter : moves high distances, seek food, other clans etc... when it come back near another cell it "share" the information.
warrior : hostile towards other clans
builder : builds farms to produce more food
no-mad : do not have a clan, seek food may be hostile to other entities

================================
STEPS INTO CREATING THE PROGRAM
================================

STEP 1 :
Create the "world" a 2D grid of about 1000 x 1000 pixels. Let's say each pixel can be an entity.
We can zoom in/out

STEP 2 :
Creating one cell
she should be able to move

STEP 3 :
initializing threads to control the world
at this point we should be able to see different cells "moving" on a 2D grid

STEP 4 :
Add in energy food with minor behaviors (searching for food)

	V1.2 - improvements AND what's done by 01/01/2026
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Created separation between object ID and object Data.
Program architecture goes as follows:

WorldData owns ChunksData and ID.
ChunksData owns CellsData and ID

...

we are already 2 days later and i still did not fully understood the architecture I'm gone with.
I think it has something to do with responsibility, data and Id's.

It is possible to create worlds, automatically chunked.

The math is working good.

For some reason the chunk maker loops cannot start at 1, so they start at 0.
Making the first chunk ID 0 x 0 even tho it should be 1 x 1 because it is a surface area.
Found out later they can start at 0, it just when testing with 1, I mistakenly forced a 0 by creating a chunk Id manually.

	V1.3 - improvements AND what's done by 05/01/2026
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

it is possible to create cells
Made an automatic decision system for cells

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	V1.4 - improvements AND what's done by 07/01/2026
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now cells can apply their decisions.
Move decision is working, and it moves the cell for one height.
Eat decision scans 3x3 square around the cell for food.
Created Stat value to better control value. (have a max and a min that cannot be gone over)
Changed cell energy from int to stat.
Can add food to world now.
Eat decision is working, and it adds energy and deletes the food data from both the world and chunk.
Eat and move resolver created and works.
